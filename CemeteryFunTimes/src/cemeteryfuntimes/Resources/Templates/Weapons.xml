    <Weapon Key="1" Unique ID that is used to look up the weapon
        Name="Pistol" Name of the weapon
        ProjectileType="1" Type of weapon:

        Damage="1" Damage per projectile, or damage per timestep
        EnemyWeapon="True" True if this weapon is for enemies and not the player
        WeaponLength="20" Length of the weapon (maybe used to draw projectiles?
        ProjectileSpeed="5" Speed of the projectiles
        ProjectileDelay="300" Minimum time between firing of the projectiles
        ProjectileOffset="20" Drawing offset for projectiles (i.e. weapon is slightly to the left of character
        ProjectileHeight="20" Height of the projectile

        ProjectileImage="Weapons/Handgun/bullet.png" Filepath for the image of the projectile
        
        -More will be added especially with weirder weapon types
        -But my plan is that the use of these variables will be conditional on the weapon type
        -So its fine to leave certain fields empty or not included on certain weapon types
