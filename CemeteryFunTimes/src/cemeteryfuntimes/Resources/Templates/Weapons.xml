                                2 - Singlular ballistic (i.e. flamethrower, laser)
        Damage="1" Damage per projectile, or damage per timestep
        WeaponLength="20" Length of the weapon (maybe used to draw projectiles?

        ProjectileImage="Weapons/Handgun/bullet.png" Filepath for the image of the projectile
        
        -More will be added especially with weirder weapon types
        -But my plan is that the use of these variables will be conditional on the weapon type
        -So its fine to leave certain fields empty or not included on certain weapon types
